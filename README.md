# STREEM

STREEM is a self-hosted music streaming server, built using HTML, CSS, JS, PHP and MySQL as a single page application.
It is designed to be lightweight and easy to install. It allows users to upload MP3 files and group them by artist and album. It also allwos the creation of playlists.
It is still a work in progress.
